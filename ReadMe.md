### ArcReactor Mod

While playing on a few multiplayer settings with various forge mods, I've found that it's virtually impossible for everyone on a larger multiplayer server to achieve "full" automation when it comes to powering all of their machines without having a "recyclable" world to plainly mine to bits and use all of those materials.

Having that said, I aim to make this mod not only provide near infinite power in the end game, but also provide a feasible means to produce and procure the end game items through working with the mod. This should mean that there will be a tiered power generator system, material creation system, "crafting" control system, and ultimately, a cabling system of it's own.

Currently, as this is the very first forge mod that I'm creating, I'm likely to have to write everything from the ground up as many mods have not updated to Minecraft 1.8 as of yet.

Additionally, this mod will be designed with multiplayer in mind, so the first integration provided, aside from ThermalFoundation, will be with providing as many event hooks as possible to keep a sense of ability for maintaining security and control for the potential server administrator.


Some things to think about:

 - Energy API that is extensible for not just the mod, but other systems
 - Expansive upgradeability
 - Integration with SpongeAPI
 - Units of measurement
 - Configurability of energy
 - World Generation
